# Reverse Proxy

Reverse proxy using [Træfik](https://traefik.io/) as an ingress controller.

## Getting started

Based on the [official guide](https://docs.traefik.io/user-guide/kubernetes/).

### Prerequisites

* A Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl

### Access Control configuration

For the sake of simplicity, use a ClusterRoleBinding for privileges

```
kubectl apply -f traefik-rbac.yaml
```

 Preferably, in accordance with the least-privileges principle, we could have used RoleBindings for only the namespaces that Træfik watches over. In that case, one RoleBinding is required per watched namespace along with a corresponding configuration of Træfik's kubernetes.namespaces parameter.

### Configuration

Configure Træfik to use HTTPS (generated by Let's Encrypt), and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS

```
kubectl apply -f traefik-config.yaml
```

### Deployment

```
kubectl apply -f traefik-deployment.yaml
```

A traefik-ingress-controller pod should now be running. Confirm by typing

```
kubectl --namespace=kube-system get pods
```

You should also be able to see the service

```
kubectl --namespace=kube-system get services
```

Remember to route HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443) traffic to the ports exposed by traefik-ingress-service

### Ingress

Write ingress rules to *ingress.yaml* and apply

```
kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml
```
